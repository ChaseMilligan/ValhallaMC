ValhallaMC SMP is an age-restricted (18+), soft-whitelisted survival server inspired by Valhalla — a living, legendary world where only the worthy earn the right to settle, claim land, and carve their name into history. Expect a friendly but competitive atmosphere: build bold, trade smart, explore deep, and battle for glory when the stakes are real.{.muted}

Anyone can join as a visitor and explore freely — roam the world, check out community builds, and get a feel for the server. But to unlock full gameplay (building, breaking, claiming land, and progressing like everyone else), you’ll need to join our **[Discord](https://discord.gg/39CVgkrBvp)** and link your Minecraft account. This keeps the server clean, social, and protected from random griefing, while still letting new players drop in and see what ValhallaMC is about.{.muted}

Once linked (or approved by an admin), you’re no longer just passing through — you’re part of the realm. Build your base, form alliances, claim territory, and start stacking your legend.{.muted}

## What’s Under The Hood?

**We run on Minecraft 1.21.10** with a curated set of server-side mods and custom resources that enhance the experience without turning it into something unrecognizable. The goal is to keep the core survival loop feeling vanilla-friendly, while adding more depth, polish, and long-term progression.{.muted}
